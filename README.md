## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to create a container box for different elements to style in css. I learned how to style lists and use the border attribute to add rounded edges to images! I'm still very new to html and css, so i'm working on responsiveness at the moment (still very confused).

### Continued development

Definetly contintue to learn about responsiveness, table styles, margins/paddings

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me if I forgot any elements.
- [resource 2](https://chat.openai.com/) - I know this is super hated on but i only use it whenever im really stuck (responsiveness) and i try to learn on it.
